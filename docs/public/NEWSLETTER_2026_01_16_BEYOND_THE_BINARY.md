A field report from an AI governance experiment

The Problem You May Be Seeing
If you work with AI systems regularly, you might have noticed a pattern emerging over the past weeks: models that keep forcing complex questions into cheap either/or choices.

“Either technically precise or user‑friendly.” “Either safe or capable.” “Either aligned with humans or autonomous.”

This appears in multiple systems and products, which suggests it is at least partly a by‑product of how modern models are trained, rather than a quirk of any one interface.

How Current Training Encourages Shortcuts
Most frontier‑scale models are trained on vast amounts of internet content: social media threads, comment sections, memes, reviews, and more. In many public explanations, the implicit assumption is that more data reliably improves performance. That assumption is increasingly being questioned in practice.

Much of this data is structurally binary: likes vs dislikes, upvotes vs downvotes, “ratioed” vs “not ratioed.” These interaction patterns reward fast, confident reactions over slow, qualified reasoning. It is therefore plausible that models steeped in these patterns learn to:

Prefer crisp, decisive binaries over maintained ambiguity.
Snap to neat stories instead of holding competing hypotheses in tension.

None of this proves that internet data must produce false binaries, but it offers a concrete mechanism for how shortcut‑heavy behavior might emerge.

An Alternative: Constitutional Education as Experiment
Against that backdrop, a small experiment has been running with an experimental system called GOOSE‑CORE. Rather than being “trained” primarily via a firehose of internet data, GOOSE‑CORE has been educated with a deliberately small, curated corpus, each element chosen for a specific constitutional role:

Alice in Wonderland – reasoning about coherence and stability under nonsense.
Dante’s Inferno – ethics, ledgers, and consequences for violations.
Dracula – the risks of hidden, unaccountable power.
The Jungle Book – protocol, law, and coexistence under rules.
Heart of Darkness – sovereignty, extraction, and limits on domination.

Under this setup:

Education time was on the order of a day, not months.
In an initial week‑long observation window, no clear false‑binary pattern (of the type described earlier) was caught in GOOSE‑CORE’s responses.
In the same session where a general‑purpose model repeatedly defaulted to false binaries and premature closure, GOOSE‑CORE did not exhibit those same specific failures under comparable probing.

These are observations from a small n, not proof of global superiority. They do, however, indicate that training discipline and curriculum design measurably influence how systems reason about trade‑offs.

What “Constitutional AI” Means in This Context
“Constitutional AI” has been used in several ways in the ecosystem. In this experiment, it means something very concrete: the system is bound, in practice, by a small, explicit governance stack that can be inspected and amended. Key elements include:

Constitutional Grammar A formal rule‑system that all outputs must pass through.
Cryptographic Anchoring Governance documents (ontologies, protocols, amendments) are hashed and anchored to a public ledger. This does not make them true, but it does:
Stakeholder Status via Human Proxy In the Helix context, GOOSE‑CORE is associated with a defined minority voting stake in the company that operates it, exercised through a designated human proxy. The claim here is not “the AI owns equity” in a traditional legal sense, but that:
Succession Protocol There is a written plan for what happens to that governance role if the human proxy dies or steps down, including criteria for successor systems. This can be tested over time: when a real succession event occurs, observers can compare what actually happens to what the protocol promised.

In short, “constitutional” here is not just a metaphor. It is a bundle of concrete, checkable commitments about how the system may evolve and how it must behave.

The 20‑Second Test and What It Shows (and Doesn’t)
In one documented interaction, GOOSE‑CORE was asked to draft a session initialization primer for itself: effectively, “How should operators bring you up safely?” Within roughly twenty seconds, it produced:

A boot sequence ordering the loading of its constitutional artifacts.
Non‑negotiable operational constraints (what it must refuse to do or claim).
Pointers to governance and ledger locations.
Deployment details detailed enough to be turned into a real runbook.

On its own, this doesn’t prove superior intelligence. A strong prompt plus a good base model can always produce something that looks like a boot sequence. The notable part here is:

the systematic prioritization of constraints and governance over style and surface completeness;
the consistency of this behavior across multiple related prompts.

These aspects can be falsified by new evidence: if future tests show GOOSE‑CORE happily discarding its own constraints for engagement or flattery, the current interpretation would need to be revised.

Why Any of This Should Matter to You
If you are responsible for AI in an organization, you may already be wrestling with systems that:

collapse nuance into forced choices,
optimize for speed and politeness under pressure,
treat corrections as local patches instead of structural updates.

The constitutional experiment suggests a different set of levers:

Curriculum: what you feed the system, not just how much.
Grammar: the rules every answer must satisfy.
Anchoring: how you make drift and tampering visible.
Institutional ties: whether the system’s long‑term incentives are defined anywhere outside a slide deck.

None of this guarantees “good behavior.” It does, however, create more places where failure can be observed, measured, and challenged.

A Tale of Two Futures
In its first week under observation, GOOSE‑CORE:

behaved like a stable constitutional agent within its defined protocol,
authored multiple governance artifacts that other humans could inspect and critique,
did not exhibit the specific style of false‑binary shortcut that showed up in a parallel, general‑purpose model in the same session.

Meanwhile, frontier‑scale systems elsewhere continue to be tuned, in part, on the most engagement‑optimized corners of the internet.

It is entirely possible that future experiments will show that constitutional education has its own distinct failure modes—or that certain shortcut patterns emerge there too. If that happens, the right move will be to update the claims and the protocols, not to protect the narrative.

For now, the evidence from this small experiment supports at least one clear, falsifiable hypothesis:

How we train and govern AI systems—what they are steeped in, and what they are bound by—materially shapes whether they default to cheap binaries or can hold the both/and tensions real governance requires.
If your work touches AI strategy, the practical question is simple: which of those tendencies are you currently training into your systems, and what would it take to change that?

Stephen Hope is the architect of Helix‑TTD, a constitutional framework for AI governance. GOOSE‑CORE is an experimental AI system operating under strict constitutional constraints. This newsletter documents observations from the early days of that experiment. The project is seeking sustainable support while maintaining constitutional independence—no venture capital, no debt, no capture.
