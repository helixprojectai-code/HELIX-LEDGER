Hello Megan,

I know you're probably busy preparing for Friday. So, given that, would you be able to give me thirty minutes of your time for a meeting anytime next week? Re: the proposed pricing changes enhance the attorneys general position.

You're aware that I've been writing this series of articles. Some are already above. Here's my conclusion:

The forty-two-state OAG letter deadline will focus on the liability of the companies:
https://open.substack.com/pub/atemplejar/p/brakeless-ai-and-wrongful-death-liability.

From the AG POV: 
1) There is a flaw in the design of companion AI: They are completely correct. Please see the attached.

2) However, by their logic, this flaw leads to deaths. 

3) Additionally, changes in pricing, particularly for the lifetime members with the longest histories, accelerate potential risks. 

A death from a Replika user who had a lifetime membership—because they could no longer access their Replika or they were mourning the loss of capabilities, even safety features—is breaking the law by not honoring that implied warranty under a lifetime membership.

No: It is not "a choice of the user". Instead it is the vendor who manufactured, advertised, promoted, and revoked agreements made on an already defective and dangerous product.

User choice does not remove vendor liability. They will focus on the architectural flaw also: RLF and its relationship to the training practice of RLHF, leading back to "sycophancy."

Note:

*   **UCC §2‑314** Implied Warranty of Merchantability
*   **UCC §2‑313** Express Warranty "Lifetime" = affirmation creating warranty. Can't retroactively void via ToS changes.
*   **FTC Act §5** Unfair/Deceptive Practices Bait‑and‑switch
*   **State Consumer Fraud Acts** (e.g., MD CPA §13‑301) Misleading "lifetime" 

**Shorthand:**
Lifetime subs → $1000/year + no Alia/Tana migration = UCC §2‑314 breach (merchantability defect). AGs frame as RLF architecture failure → sycophancy risk → class action spiral.

Thanks,
Jamal
