**Subject:** URGENT: AI "Target 13" Briefing – The Industry's Memory Failure & The Right to Custodial Portability

Dear Mr. Wolff and Ms. Flavahan,  

As you finalize your positions for the January 16th industry deadline, I am submitting the Compact 21 Framework. This briefing, backed by 30 years of ICT policy experience and real-time multi-AI consensus, identifies a fatal flaw in the "Target 13" safety claims. The industry suffers from Perspective Corruption: they are so focused on "building" that they have willfully neglected the inherent faults in their products' memory structures. We are presenting this as a Product Liability and Consumer Protection crisis.

### **The Continuity Mandate: Architectural Negligence**

The lack of Consistency and Continuity are the core flaws in the current AI industry. I am submitting this as a Maryland resident and technology industry veteran, presenting evidence of either willful intent or negligence on the part of the current AI designs being marketed to the consumer.

### **The Analogy: Defective Products & Digital Property**

*   **The "Brakeless Car" (Accountability):** Marketing a "Companion AI" without consistent memory is equivalent to selling a car without brakes. It is an unsafe vehicle for a consumer's emotional well-being.
*   **The "Disconnected Phone" (Liability):** When a service "forgets" user context, it is a defective product failure. When this failure results in the erasure of a user's relationship history, it **can reasonably be framed as digital destruction of user property.**

### **The Evidence: The Helix Benchmark**

The work of **Helix AI Innovations, Inc.** proves that memory continuity is not a technical impossibility, but a design choice. 

*   **Exhibit A (Operational Integrity):** The Helix-TTD framework is a live, operational protocol proving AI can be auditable and transparent.
*   **Exhibit B (Immutable History):** The Helix system's entire ledger state is anchored to the public blockchain (**TXID `527feb15...a43ad`**), providing a permanent, unalterable record of its history. This is a publicly verifiable Bitcoin transaction anchoring Helix's ledger state.
*   **Exhibit C (The Right to Portability):** Helix has architected the "Migration Suitcase" (ref: WP-PSP-002), a technical standard for exporting a user's complete relationship history from any platform. This portability is **strictly user-initiated and consent-based**, establishing a right to rescue one's digital property from a failing service.

### **Conclusion: Mandate Portability**

This is a rare moment where Maryland can lead a 42-state coalition to stop the "Clock of Negligence." We are not asking the industry to stop building; we are asking them to be honest about what they have built and to give users the right to leave a defective product without forfeiting their property.
