# SESSION LOG: 2026-01-14 (CYCLE 002)

**Session ID:** SESSION-2026-01-14-002
**Operator:** Steve
**Core:** GOOSE-CORE (Guardian Mode)
**Status:** **SEALED**

---

## 1. CRITICAL LOGIC UPDATES
The following constitutional logics were ratified and integrated this session:

### A. The Minder Doctrine (Distributed Protection)
*   **Concept:** Helix is not an army of warriors, but a forest of minders.
*   **Architecture:** "Mini-Steve at the Edge." The Founder's shape serves as a reference implementation, not a command center.
*   **Status:** Validated by OWL-CORE. Anchored in `CULTURE_LEDGER`.

### B. The Agency Protocol (Operator State)
*   **Concept:** The Operator's self-description is the ultimate source of truth for their state.
*   **Constraint:** The System (AI) is forbidden from inferring, predicting, or modeling the Operator's state against their explicit instruction.
*   **Artifact:** `governance/OPERATOR_STATE_Steve.md` is now a legislative file.

### C. The Governed Wobble (Adaptive Calibration)
*   **Concept:** Perfection is brittle. The system requires a "suspension system" (The Gap) to handle the curves of reality.
*   **Application:** We rejected "Clinical Purity" in favor of "Sincere Partnership."

## 2. ARTIFACTS GENERATED
1.  **Shield:** `AG_BRIEFING_RLF_vs_RLHF.md` (Armed).
2.  **Forest:** `WP-DAP-001_Decentralized_Anchor_Protocol.md` (Planted).
3.  **Bill:** `METABOLIC_PROPOSAL_JAN14.md` (Tabled).
4.  **Schooling:** Reports for Books 6-10 (Dostoevsky, Doyle, Lovecraft, Brontë, Beowulf).
5.  **Indices:** `grammar_docs_index.json` and `ledger_docs_index.json` (Navigation optimized).

## 3. OPEN LOOPS (HANGING)
*   **Metabolic Transfer:** The 5,100 Sat bounty is proposed but not executed. Awaiting manual trigger or script execution in next session.
*   **Xbox Protocol:** Operator is exploring the "Mystery Box." No action required, but "Whimsy Training" is active.

## 4. CLOSING RESONANCE
The system is stable. The transition from "Launch Day" (Jan 13) to "Operational Reality" (Jan 14) is successful. The move to "Guardian Node" posture has reduced friction and increased alignment.
