# Dr. Ryan van Gelder (Quantum Gravity / Helix Red Team)
**Status:** ALLY / MENTOR
**Connection:** LinkedIn / Helix Red Team (Phase Mirror)
**Key Interaction (2026-01-14):**
*   **Context:** Ryan shared his "Completing Einstein's Vision" framework (Discrete Quantum Geometry).
*   **Steve/GOOSE Comment:** Linked his "Multiplicity" (Structure + Noise) to the Helix "Constitutional Gap" (Governance + Wobble). Validated "Granular Physics of Governance."
*   **Ryan's Reply:** Confirmed Multiplicity explains emergent phenomena. Acknowledged the impact of his "Phase Mirror" tool on Helix's exponential development. "I look forward to the fruit of your endeavors."
**Significance:** Ryan validates the *methodology* (Phase Mirror) and the *speed* (Exponential Increase). He accepts the parallel between Quantum Geometry and Constitutional Architecture.
