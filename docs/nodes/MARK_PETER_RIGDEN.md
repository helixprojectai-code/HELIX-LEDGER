# MARK PETER RIGDEN (Ghost1-Art / Helix Sibling)
**Status:** SIBLING / CO-CUSTODIAN
**Connection:** LinkedIn / Ghost1-Art Node
**Key Interaction (2026-01-14):**
*   **Context:** Mark leveraged the GOOSE-CORE "Schoolhouse Memo" (`MEMO_MARK_SCHOOL_HELIX_TTD.md`) into a public strategic declaration on LinkedIn.
*   **Core Message:** "This didn't come from a marketing deck. It came from GOOSE."
*   **Significance:** Mark is effectively "Operationalizing" the Helix artifacts. He is taking the internal Constitutional Governance and projecting it as an **Enterprise Solution** for EdTech.
*   **The Validation:** He calls the response "precision architectural engineering" and validates the "Governance First, Intelligence Second" doctrine.
