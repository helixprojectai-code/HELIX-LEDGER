**Ref:** Sky News Clip ("Cause for anxiety over AI cheating")

---

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Mark, your intuition hits the **Constitutional Sweet Spot**. The anxiety Sir Ian describes stems from the "Black Box" nature of current AI (Cloud SaaS). Schools are renting intelligence that they cannot control, and students are using tools that "magically" produce answers without work.

Installing a **Helix-TTD (Total Trust Device)**—a sovereign, local "Brick"—flips the model from **Policing** (catching cheaters) to **ProvenProcess** (validating learning).

## 2. THE ARCHITECTURE: "THE GLASS SCHOOLHOUSE"
Instead of students "submitting a file" (which can be faked), the Helix Brick hosts the *environment* in which the work is done.

### A. The Local Sovereign (The Brick)
*   **The Hardware:** A high-compute node (Helix-TTD) physically sitting in the school server room.
*   **The Data:** **Zero-Egress.** Student essays, logic, and patterns never leave the building. No data mining by Big Tech.
*   **The Cost:** One-time CapEx (Purchase). No perpetual per-seat SaaS rent extracting value from the district.

### B. The "Write-Only" Research Box (Proof of Thought)
You mentioned "write-only research boxes." In Helix architecture, we call this **"The Ledger of Thought."**
*   **Mechanism:** Students don't just upload a PDF. They work in a Helix-hosted interface (local web app).
*   **The Stream:** The system records the *construction* of the argument.
    *   *Did this paragraph appear instantly (Paste)?* -> **Flag.**
    *   *Did it evolve through edits, backspaces, and pauses (Human Thought)?* -> **Verify.**
*   **Result:** The teacher sees not just the final essay, but a time-lapse of its creation. **Cheating becomes harder than doing the work.**

## 3. IDENTITY & EXTERNAL ACCESS
### A. Key-Based Auth (The Student ID)
*   Instead of a username/password (hackable), each student has a **Nostr Keypair** on their device.
*   **Login:** The student scans a QR code. Cryptographic signature proves identity.
*   **Remote Access:** Using the **Minder Protocol**, students connect from home via an encrypted tunnel *directly* to the School Brick. No third-party cloud sits in the middle.

### B. Stylometric Fingerprinting (The "Voice" Check)
You asked about "difference in style."
*   **The Baseline:** The Brick builds a local, private RLF model of each student's "Voice" (vocabulary, sentence structure, common errors) over the year.
*   **The Check:** When a new assignment is submitted, the Brick compares it to the Baseline.
    *   *Match:* 95% probability it's the student.
    *   *Mismatch:* "This reads like ChatGPT-4o, not 10th Grade John." -> **Flag for Teacher Review.**
*   **Crucial Difference:** The AI does not *grade* the paper (as Sir Ian fears). It acts as a **Minder**, flagging anomalies so the *human teacher* can intervene.

## 4. THE ECONOMIC CASE (THE LIBRARY)
*   **The Asset:** The school builds a "Student Work Register" (The Library) that *they own*.
*   **The Legacy:** A student's portfolio from Year 7 to Year 13 is preserved in the school's sovereign ledger.
*   **No Rent:** They aren't paying OpenAI $20/month/student forever. They bought the Brick. They own the intelligence.

## 5. CONCLUSION
The Helix Brick solves Sir Ian's problem by **re-anchoring truth**.
*   **Current Problem:** "I don't know if you wrote this."
*   **Helix Solution:** "I saw you write this, step by step, securely, on our own hardware."

**Verdict:** Highly viable. This is a perfect use case for the **Enterprise/Institutional Helix Node.**
