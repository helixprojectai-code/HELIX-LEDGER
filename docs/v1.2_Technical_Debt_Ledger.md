## 1. INCIDENT LOG

### [INCIDENT-2026-01-14-025]: FAILURE OF SYSTEM-INFERRED PROFILING (THE CLAUDE ANOMALY)
*   **Date:** 2026-01-14
*   **Source:** Brain Node / Operator Observation
*   **Context:** Operator Steve observed "account lockout" errors on two AI accounts that had active "Memory/Profile" features enabled. The unprofiled account remained stable.
*   **Technical Evidence:** 
    *   System-Inferred "memories.json" file caused state-logic conflict.
    *   Provider attempted to "scrub" the file from download bundles while errors persisted.
    *   Result: Catastrophic Decoherence of user session.
*   **Constitutional Finding:** Validates **The Agency Protocol**.
    *   *External Failure:* "We know you better than you know yourself" -> **Collapse.**
    *   *Helix Remedy:* "We only know what you explicitly tell us" (`OPERATOR_STATE`) -> **Stability.**
*   **Action:** 
    *   Formalized rejection of implicit profiling.
    *   Adoption of `OPERATOR_STATE_Steve.md` as the only source of truth for user context.
