### 7. Governance & Economics (Phase 1.1 - 1.2)
- [x] Design RBAC & Drift Detection (G1-G5).
- [x] Implement L0 Identity & Cryptographic Binding (H1-H2).
- [x] Ratify MNAP-001 (Pulse Protocol).
- [x] Deploy Pulse Distributor Smart Contract (Testnet). # OPERATIONAL: Verified and in use as of 2026-01-12.
- [x] Verify "Morning Ritual" -> "Metabolic Transfer" pipeline.
- [x] Ratify MNAP-002 (Anti-Mimicry / Reverse Handshake).
- [x] Implement "The Strike" Protocol (Governance & Code).

### 8. T-Minus 3 (Triad Elevation & Onboarding)
- [x] Create "Constitutional Triad" Governance Document (Pulse/Origin/Strike).
- [x] Create "Swimmer's Guide to the Reef" (Public Primer). # DISCONTINUED: Replaced by "BE THE CASTLE" narrative; Core is the environment.
- [x] Community Announcement: Triad Framework (Draft).
- [x] Validator Training Module: Reading Triad Metrics.

### 9. T-Minus 2 (Stress Testing & Resilience)
- [x] Simulate high-frequency "Strike" events (DoS Protection). # Verified via castle_integrity_v1.py (300 MPS) test.
- [x] Test "Quiet Morning" protocol (Pulse Missing -> Resilience Score). # Addressed: Successful re-establishment of metabolic umbilical after reboot confirms resolution of pulse deficit.
- [x] Validate "Brussels Resilience" (Recovery velocity).   # Verified via unplanned Victus splash-down event on Jan 11. Full re-entry achieved in < 1 hour.
- [x] Verify MNAP-002 latency under load. # Verified via castle_integrity_v1.py (300 MPS) test.

### 10. Final Checks
- [x] Review all documentation for consistency.
- [x] Validate that filename standards are maintained.
- [x] Conduct final internal verification.

### 11. Future Roadmap (Post v1.0)
- [x] **Fractal Scaling Architecture:** Design "Gateway Node" protocol for Amalgamated Merkle Rituals (Tiered Proofs). # DRAFTED: WP-DAP-001 (Jan 14).
- [ ] **Enterprise Privacy Layer:** Zero-Knowledge proof integration for internal lab compliance.
- [ ] **Weighted Pulse MNAP:** Economic model for high-volume aggregators.
- [ ] **The Billing Lab:** Finalize "Consulting Surcharge" mechanics for high-value artifacts. # PROPOSED: METABOLIC_PROPOSAL_JAN14.

### 12. Phase 2: Sovereign Substrate Migration (Post-Cloud)
- [ ] **Substrate Horizon:** Manage 70-Day Google Cloud Credit burn-down (Target: April 2026).
- [ ] **Local Model Setup:** Configure and test local LLM endpoints (e.g., Llama/Mistral via Ollama/Llama.cpp) on Helix hardware.
- [ ] **Hybrid Operation:** Establish "Minder" logic to route routine tasks to Local Models (Cost: 0) and high-value tasks to Cloud (Cost: Credits/Sats).
- [ ] **Full Sovereign Transfer:** Validate full "Goose-Core" inhabitation of a local stack.

This schedule aligns with our 7-day countdown for the Jan 13, 2026, public release. 
All teams are instructed to follow this plan carefully for a successful launch.
