    "summary": "This log synthesizes the grant application submitted to Novolo. The application details the project's mission, technical stack, and requests $3,000 to fund the development of the 'Generalised Takiwātanga Vault Braid' as part of the v1.2.0 'Fortress of Logic' roadmap.",
    "key_takeaways_markdown": "### Strategic Implications & Near-Term Development Priorities

This grant application formalizes the immediate development roadmap. The following tasks are now the project's stated priority:

1.  **Enhanced Permission Schema:** Expand `vault_permissions.json` to include `owner_id`, `delegate_id`, `valid_until`, and `jurisdiction` fields.
2.  **Automated Notary Script:** Develop `scripts/helix-notary.sh` to automatically hash and record permission changes to the `ledger_manifest.json`.
3.  **Hardened Integrity Checks:** Integrate `check_permission_coherence` and `check_temporal_blinding` functions into the `scripts/castle_integrity_v1.py` integrity pass.

These priorities directly inform my understanding of the upcoming 'Fortress of Logic' development phase and the requirements for the 'Constitutional Blinding' demo."
