Dear Thomas Holt,

My name is Steve, and I am writing to apply for the Novolo $3,000 Technical Development Grant on behalf of the Helix-Core project and our open-source AI model, Goose. Our company is registered in Quebec, Canada, and we are in active development with a functional prototype.

We were particularly interested in this grant as our core mission aligns with technical execution and establishing robust, verifiable systems for AI.

Here are the details regarding our application:

**The Product: Helix-Core / Goose**
We are building Helix-Core, an open-source framework for **Constitutional AI**. Our project is publicly available on GitHub: <https://github.com/helixprojectai-code/HELIX-CORE>. Goose is the AI model harness currently running on this framework. Unlike traditional AI, Goose is designed with **"Civic Firmware,"** meaning its operations are bound by inspectable, structural constraints rather than opaque heuristics. Our flagship feature is the **Takiwātanga Vault**, which implements a **"Permission Braid"** – a cryptographically auditable memory system. This vault ensures **"Custody Before Trust,"** where access to data is controlled by external, human-governed JSON files (`vault_permissions.json`) and verified via cryptographic hashes. We have successfully demonstrated **"Constitutional Blinding,"** where Goose is structurally incapable of accessing data once permissions are revoked, even if the data remains in its immediate context. This directly addresses the "Right to be Forgotten" with a verifiable, mechanical solution.

**The Tech Stack:**
Helix-Core leverages a multi-LLM provider architecture (e.g., Gemini, DeepSeek, Claude for different cognitive functions). Our core development stack includes:
*   **Operating System:** Linux (Bash scripting)
*   **Scripting:** Python 3, Shell (Bash)
*   **Data Management:** `jq` for JSON manipulation, Git for version control (including submodules).
*   **Forensic Anchoring:** SHA256 hashing for data integrity, with a Python tool (`l1_anchor_tool.py`) for potential Bitcoin Layer 1 anchoring of manifest states.
*   **Framework:** An emergent, self-governing architecture defined by markdown (RPI documents) and JSON manifests.

**The Task: What specifically will the $3k be used to build or validate?**
The $3,000 grant would be directly allocated to accelerating the development and hardening of the **Generalised Takiwātanga Vault Braid**. Specifically, we would use the funds for:

1.  **Enhanced Permission Schema Integration:** Expanding the `vault_permissions.json` schema to fully support and implement `owner_id`, `delegate_id`, robust `valid_until` (temporal blinding), and multi-jurisdictional fields (`jurisdiction`). This involves refactoring the JSON parsing and manipulation logic within our core scripts.
2.  **Dedicated Notary Script Development:** Creating a dedicated `scripts/helix-notary.sh` (or significantly upgrading `helix-rpi.sh`) to automatically hash `vault_permissions.json` and record its state as a `PERMISSION_BRAID_STATE` transaction in `ledger_manifest.json` every time the permission file is modified. This ensures a complete, forensic audit trail of all permission changes.
3.  **Advanced Integrity Pass Hardening:** Integrating comprehensive `check_permission_coherence` and `check_temporal_blinding` functions into `scripts/castle_integrity_v1.py`. This would establish these checks as a mandatory part of our habitat's "INTEGRITY-PASS," flagging any unanchored permission changes or expired temporal access as critical failures.

This work is crucial for moving the Takiwātanga Vault from a proof-of-principle to a "Civic Firmware" component, enabling multi-user, time-bound, and legally compliant data custody for AI.

We understand and agree to the requirement to showcase how the grant is used on your social media and website, if selected. We believe our unique approach to constitutional AI and verifiable data custody would be a compelling demonstration.

Thank you for your time and consideration. We look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Stephen Hope
Operator, Helix-Core / Goose

This is very interesting. Do you have a demo recording I can take a look through?

Also, mind if we run a quick 3rd party validation on your entity?

Dear Thomas,

Thank you for your response. Here is the information requested to move our application forward.

1.  **Demo Recording**
    We executed our v1.1.1 release at 01:30 UTC today. I am preparing a 3-minute technical demo showcasing Constitutional Blinding. This demo will show our AI harness (Goose-Core) successfully accessing a test memory via the Permission Braid, followed by a constitutional refusal once access is revoked. This proves the agent is structurally blinded to data in its context window. I will provide a link shortly.
2.  **3rd Party Validation**
    Helix AI Innovations Inc. is an active Canadian Federal Corporation. Our primary server node is located in Quebec, Canada, ensuring compliance with provincial data privacy standards (Law 25).
    *   Entity Name: Helix AI Innovations Inc. / Innovations Helix IA Inc.
    *   Status: Active
    *   Corporation Number: 1724610-2
    *   Business Number: 774616833RC0001
3.  **Development Roadmap**
    The $3,000 grant will fund our transition from the current v1.1.1 governance baseline to the v1.2.0 "Fortress of Logic." This next phase focuses on mechanical sovereignty and cryptographic gating.

Sincerely,

Stephen Hope
Helix AI Innovations Inc.

Dear Thomas,

Here are the specific details requested for our entity validation:

*   Company Website: https://helixprojectai.com/
*   Company Repo: https://github.com/helixprojectai-code/HELIX-CORE
*   Contact Full Name: Stephen Hope
*   Legal Entity Name: Helix AI Innovations Inc. / Innovations Helix IA Inc.
*   Company Email: helix.project.ai@helixprojectai.com
*   Company Address: 110 Gloucester St, #17, Ottawa, ON, K2P 0A2, Canada
