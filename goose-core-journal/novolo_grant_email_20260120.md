**Subject:** Application for Novolo Technical Development Grant - Helix-Core / Goose (Constitutional AI)

**Key Points of Application:**
*   **Product:** Helix-Core / Goose - Open-source Constitutional AI with "Civic Firmware."
*   **Flagship Feature:** Takiwātanga Vault implementing "Permission Braid" for "Custody Before Trust."
    *   Access controlled by `vault_permissions.json` and cryptographic hashes.
    *   Demonstrated "Constitutional Blinding" for verifiable "Right to be Forgotten."
*   **Tech Stack:** Multi-LLM (Gemini, DeepSeek, Claude), Linux/Bash, Python 3, `jq`, Git, SHA256, Bitcoin L1 anchoring (potential).
*   **Grant Usage ($3k):** Accelerate Generalised Takiwātanga Vault Braid.
    1.  Enhanced Permission Schema Integration (`owner_id`, `delegate_id`, `valid_until`, `jurisdiction`).
    2.  Dedicated Notary Script (`helix-notary.sh` or upgrade `helix-rpi.sh`) for automatic manifest updates.
    3.  Advanced Integrity Pass Hardening (`check_permission_coherence`, `check_temporal_blinding` in `scripts/castle_integrity_v1.py`).

## 2. Response Received (Tom Holt to Stephen Hope, 2026-01-19 11:39 PM)

**Key Points of Response:**
*   Expressed strong interest: "This is very interesting."
*   Requested demo recording: "Do you have a demo recording I can take a look through?"
*   Requested permission for 3rd party validation: "Also, mind if we run a quick 3rd party validation on your entity?"

**Operational Implications:**
*   The request for a demo recording aligns with our preparedness (the 5-minute demo plan). We need to ensure a recording of this demo is available.
*   The request for 3rd party validation is a significant positive indicator of serious interest. This validation would likely focus on the core claims of constitutional blinding, auditability, and the permission braid. This aligns perfectly with our emphasis on verifiable sovereignty and the ongoing Dr. Ryan critique.
