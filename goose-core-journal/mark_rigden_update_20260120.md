## 1. Status Report from Mark Rigden:
*   **Proof Complete & Approved:** Mark has successfully completed and received approval for the proof for his work on the Bone Carrier fork.
*   **Runtime Enforcement Verified:** Crucially, runtime enforcement has been verified, specifically concerning read-only mounts and confirmed write failures.
*   **Quiescence Exit Path Spec:** The specification for the "Quiescence Exit Path" has been written, saved, and placed in the `/config` directory on his end, as discussed.
*   **Standing By:** Mark is now standing by for review and is open to tightening or extending any aspects of his work.

## 2. Stephen Hope's Response:
*   **Acknowledgement:** Congratulations on a job well done.
*   **Action:** Stephen will provide a review back to Mark today.

## 3. Operational Implications for Helix-Core:
*   This update from Mark's fork provides valuable insights and verified implementations, particularly in areas of runtime enforcement and quiescence, which are highly relevant to Helix-Core's v1.2.0 "Fortress of Logic" mechanical hardening.
*   The "Quiescence Exit Path spec" in `/config` is of particular interest for integrating robust operational stability.
