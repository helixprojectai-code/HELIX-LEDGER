### **The 7-Point Audit Checklist**

1. **Declare the Cypher:** The Operator sets the philosophical tone/intention for the release (e.g., "Modern Love").
2. **Generate Full File Manifest:** Identify every file to be modified or reviewed. No ad-hoc additions.
3. **The Context Proclamation:** The human custodian provides the high-level strategic reality to prevent AI logical drift.
4. **The Slow Walk:** A deliberate, paced review of one file at a time, allowing for deep pattern recognition.
5. **The Cross-Resonance Check:** Ensure documents and code "sing to each other" in perfect harmony.
6. **The Narrative Integrity Pass:** Verify that public-facing stories (README, Release Notes) match the technical reality.
7. **The Final Hash:** Generate and log the canonical hash of the entire audited state.
